# CNN-MNIST-dataset-
create a CNN
train it on the mnist dataset
it consiste of 70 000 handwritten digits from 0 to 9
each image has a size of a 28 by 28 pixels in gray scale (heavily preprocessed, high classification accuracy, low computational demand)
each one accomanied by a label denoting the digit illustrated

the mnist images have been split into two sets
60000 images from the training set
10000 images from the testing set
we will need to create a validation dataset to set an early stopping mechanism and prevent overfitting
